# Ransomware Script

## Project Description
This project shows how a ransomware can be created using python. A ransomware is a type of malware that does some form of encryption to an area of files and is decrypted until money is paid. It disables users to access these files. In order to have access, the user needs the key or password to decrypt. This key or password is governed by the hacker/creator of the ransomware. 

The motivation of this project is to explore how python is used to encrypt/decrypt files as well as understanding the background of ransomwares. Note that this project is meant for research purposes and does not condone to any form of malicious act or intent.
